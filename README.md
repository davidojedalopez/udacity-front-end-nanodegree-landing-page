# Landing page

This project shows a very basic landing page with placeholder titles and text.

The navigation bar is built dynamically depending on the section Elements present in the HTML document. Each navigation link automatically scrolls to the given section on click.

Also, sections are highlighted whenever the user is manually scrolling through the page. This is done using the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API).
